# MikkiNavarroWalletConsoleAppTests

This is the seperate GIT repo for the test for the Wallet Console App. I lack the time to complete the unit tests as Moq is new to me. 
If I had more time I want to implement the complete unit test but the general idea is to use Moq to mock the DB connections and perform unit tests as normal.
